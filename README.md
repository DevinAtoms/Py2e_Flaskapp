# Py2e_Flaskapp

### This is kind of another take on my Py2E project, with the original being more desktop/cli while this is a flask webapp.
An attempt to make dynamically generated spell cards based on JSON from the Herolab Online API.

This was originally sort of a personal Homepage, but it turned into what it is. It's not pretty, but it's something.

There is a third project, an attempt to scrape Archives of Nethys using Selenium and Beautifulsoup, but it probably won't see the light of day.
