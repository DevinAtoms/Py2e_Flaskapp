# Py2e_Flaskapp

### This is kind of an extension of my Py2E project.
Mostly an attempt to make dynamically generated spell cards based on spell list exports from the main Py2E project.

This was originally sort of a personal Homepage, but it turned into what it is. It's not pretty, but it's something.

There is a third project, an attempt to scrape Archives of Nethys using Selenium and Beautifulsoup, but it probably won't see the light of day.
