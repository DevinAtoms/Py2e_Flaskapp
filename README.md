# Py2e_Flaskapp

### This is kind of another take on my Py2E project, with the original being more desktop/cli while this is a flask webapp.
An attempt to make dynamically generated spell cards based on JSON from the Herolab Online API.

This was originally sort of a personal Homepage, but it turned into what it is. It's not pretty, but it's something.

There's also a bit of an attempt to scrape Archives of Nethys for information, but I wasn't super successful with parsing the HTML reliably. I had another, larger web scraping project, but I believe it got lost during a HDD wipe and most likely won't see the light of day.
